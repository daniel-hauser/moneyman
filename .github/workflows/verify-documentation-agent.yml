             - Configuration examples match the current schema
             - Links to workflows and files are correct
             - Environment variables are documented correctly
             - Storage provider setup instructions are current

          2. **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Verify that:
             - Project overview is accurate
             - Architecture components are up to date
             - Development workflow instructions are correct
             - Key dependencies list is current

          **Instructions:**
