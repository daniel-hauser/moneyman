            Please verify the following documentation files are accurate and up to date:

               - All mentioned features are still supported
               - Configuration examples match the current schema
               - Links to workflows and files are correct
               - Environment variables are documented correctly
               - Storage provider setup instructions are current

            2. **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Verify that:
               - Project overview is accurate
               - Architecture components are up to date
               - Development workflow instructions are correct
               - Key dependencies list is current
               - Common development tasks are accurate

            **Instructions:**
            - Review both documentation files thoroughly
            - Check against the current codebase (config schema, package.json, workflows, etc.)
            - If everything is correct and up to date, close this issue with a comment confirming verification
            - If issues are found, create **ONE** new issue listing all documentation updates needed, then close this verification issue
            - Do not create multiple issues - consolidate all findings into a single issue
