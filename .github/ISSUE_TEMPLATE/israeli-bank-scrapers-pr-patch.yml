        This issue is to patch the israeli-bank-scrapers package to contain the changes in the PR. Do not modify the patch file directly, you must use the patch-package package for that.

        ## Steps

        **Important:** Apply patches to existing node_modules, don't replace them!

        - [ ] Run `npm ci` to install dependencies and apply existing patches
        - [ ] Verify the existing patch was applied by checking the modified files in node_modules
        - [ ] Review the PR changes on GitHub to understand what needs to be changed
        - [ ] Apply the PR changes directly to the files in node_modules (on top of existing patches)
        - [ ] Run `npx patch-package israeli-bank-scrapers` to update the patch file
        - [ ] Verify the updated patch contains both old and new changes

        **Note:** Review the PR diff on GitHub directly. Do NOT clone/build the PR branch and copy files to node_modules as this will replace existing patches. Instead, manually apply the changes from the PR to the existing files in node_modules.
